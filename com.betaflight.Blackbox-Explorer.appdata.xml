	<description>
		<p>
			Betaflight Blackbox Explorer is a crossplatform configuration tool for the Betaflight flight control system.
			It allows you to view and analyse logs that the Betaflight software has created during a flight.
			Various types of aircraft are supported by the tool and by Betaflight, e.g. quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters and fixed-wing aircraft.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Blackbox Viewer is the only log viewer with support for Betaflight specific features. It will likely require that you
			run the latest firmware on the flight controller. If you are experiencing any problems please make sure you are running
			the latest firmware version.
